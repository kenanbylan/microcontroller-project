# microcontroller-project

<p>In my project assignment on embedded systems within the scope of the microcontroller course, amplifying an audio frequency with the PIC16F877 chip using the Opamp Peak Detector and converting this signal from analog to digital with ADC and the resulting signal value was shown on the conversion leds. </p>

Used :
<p>ADC</p>
<p>PICF16877</p>
<p>OPAMP PEAK DETECTOR</p>
